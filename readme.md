# Library Apps

An library app built on Python DJango, the feature would be implemented:

1. Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. Option to add, edit, view and delete all the books by admin.
3. Using Local Storage to store the JWT so that we only allow logged-in users to buy books.
4. Option to pay using Stripe Checkout and thus creating a new order and emptying the cart after payment is successful.
5. Option to view all your past orders along with the bill amount for each.

**Technologies used** :

1. Frontend: HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap4)
